# Arduino/PR_REM_Peripheral

This part of the project was created using the [PlatformIO IDE extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide) and is compatible with the Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller. This code should also be able to work with copies of the UNO R3, which was mainly used in this project.

## Running the code

1) Open this folder in Visual Studio Code (File -> Open Folder). Then compile (to ensure compatability) and flash the code to your device. Ensure your device's USB port is connected before flashing.

2) Verify the device's operation by monitoring its output via Serial Monitor. PlatformIO should come with a serial monitor, but otherwise feel free to use any.

3) Wire the whole project *(picture will be coming soon at some point of the project's conclusion).*
