# Project Room Environment Module

*because why not?*

Project Room Environment Module ***(PR_REM)*** is a Arduino-based project meant to deep dive into Particle's PaaS environment with the goofy intent of ***"understanding the environment of my bedroom."*** The module tracks environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and light level for analysis through a web client dashboard application, which can also send messages to the physical *module.*

## ðŸ”§ Hardware/Sensors
> *Most hardware sourced from* **[Elegoo Arduino Super Starter Kit](https://www.elegoo.com/blogs/arduino-projects/elegoo-uno-project-super-starter-kit-tutorial)** 

- __Arduino Uno R3__ (Elegoo copy)
- [__Particle Argon__](https://docs.particle.io/argon/)
- Photoresistor
- 16x2 LCD Screen
- 10k Ohm Potentiometer
- Switch buttons
- DHT-11 Sensor with simplified board
- ~~Light [type is TBD]~~ *In later product release?*

## ðŸš€ Software Stack

- ðŸ”· **Particle** ~ IoT PaaS that handles internet-based interactions such as sending data to 3rd party databases
- ðŸ“„ **Google Sheets** ~ Google's spreadsheet platform, used to place data *(in other words, used as a temporary database)*. Uses ___Google Apps Scripts___ for handling data posts.
- ðŸŸ© **Arduino** ~ Popular, public domain microcontroller environment to prototype electronic designs easily using **C/C++**
- âš› **ReactJS** ~ Highly 
    - ðŸ“¡ **Axios** ~ Yet another production level
    - âš¡**NextJS**

## ðŸ”§ Running the Project

> Dedicated Instructables page will be made a few weeks after project conclusion
